              <p>- CDs</p>
              <p>- DVDs</p>

              <h5>The risks of using Removable Media</h5>
              <p>To begin with, Removable media includes many risks, as they store huge quantities of sensitive
                information. Removable media are capable of importing malicious content, exposing different types of
                data to risks. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <h6>Loss of Information</h6>
              <p>Large volumes of sensitive information is equipped to be lost, due to the fact that removable media is
                very easily lost. Removable media, such as USBs, can be easily stolen, hence, critical and senitive
                infomration could fall into the wrong hands, leading to the leakage of such informations. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <h7>Introduction of Malware</h7>
              <p>To begin with, malware is a type of software assembled to cause a disturbance to a computer system,
                server or a computer network. According to various studies, it is found that malware delivered through
                removable media, nearly doubled in 2020. </p>
              <p>Attackers intends to use removable devices, such as hard disks and USBs, to store a malware, which will
                then be connected to a computer, leading to the spread of a malware. A cybercrime group can send USB
                thumb drives to a group of people, intended as an advertisement for a company that does not exist, in
                the hope that recipients will plug them into their PCs and will instal a random malware on their
                networks, allowing attackers a full access to their networks. </p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <h8>How can you protect our data?</h8>
              <p></p>

              <strong>1. Do not plug any unknown removable media you find into your computer. If you find any type of
                removable media, give it to the appropriate authorities or leave it.</strong>

              <p></p>

              <strong>2. Use encryption and passwords on your removable devices, as they allow you to take advantage of
                security features to protect your data and information</strong>

              <p></p>

              <strong>3. Keep all security software up to date and keep maintaining them. It is highly recommended to
                use a firewall and anti-spyware software to avoid attacks to your computer.</strong>
