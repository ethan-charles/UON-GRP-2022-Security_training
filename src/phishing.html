        <h3><a>What is Phishing?</a></h3>
        <p>Phishing is a type of attack using social engineering where someone will send an email/text message pretending to be a trusted entity and tricks the person into opening a malicious link. This can lead to the installation of malware that can have multiple effects like stealing personal information or making the system unusable until a fee is paid (ransomware).</p>
        <p>There are 2 main phishing techniques.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><a>Email Phishing Scams</a></h3>
        <p>Attackers sends out thousands of indiscriminate fraudulent emails, hoping to scam as many people as possible. They will try their absolute hardest to mimic emails from real organisations. This includes the same phrasing, logos, signatures, layout etc. so it’s important to know how to differentiate phishing emails from real emails.</p>
        <p>To get the victims to interact with the email, attackers will create a sense of urgency. This could be anything from your account expiring or a password change. Examples like account expiring also apply a time pressure which makes the user more prone to error.</p>
        <p>Another way to trick the user into thinking the email is legitimate is to create domains that closely resemble the real organisation’s website</p>

        <h3><a>Spear Phishing</a> </h3>
        <p>This is a more in-depth, targeted version of phishing. Spear phishing is when someone is trying to use phishing techniques to infiltrate a specific organisation. </p>
        <p>This is done by knowing specific knowledge from the organisation like the name of the manager, email layouts, signatures etc. </p>
        <p>Knowing this knowledge, the attackers can, for example, send a fake email posing as the manager asking them to click a link, leading to them being able to steal sensitive information or install malware on internal networks.</p>
        <h3><a>How to Avoid Phishing</a></h3>
        <p>There are a few easy ways to avoid phishing</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Check the email address, not the sender</b> - This is probably the most efficient way of finding attacks. Scammers don’t have access to the real organisations domain, so they have to use fake emails. The biggest tell is after the @ symbol, as companies usually have their own. If it is a public email domain (@outlook.com, @gmail.com, @aol.com) or anything else that isn’t the organisation’s domain, you can safely say it’s a scam</li>

          <li><b>The spelling and grammar of the email</b> -  This is a common indicator. Professional emails don’t have this problem so it’s an easy indicator of a phishing attempt</li>
          <li><b>The links are suspicious</b> – If you hover over a link, a small pop up will show what the link will lead to (which isn’t always the same as what’s written)</li>

        <p>The key to your safety is to be vigilant. Hopefully these tips and tricks can help you stay safe</p>
