      <div class="about-desc">
        <p>I’m sure you’ve heard about the importance of passwords from a young age but there’s a reason for that. A password can be the only thing someone needs to get into your accounts and cause all sorts of trouble. This should be able to help you to keep your passwords secure</p>
        <h3><a>Password Guidelines</a></h3>
        <p>When thinking of a password, it usually starts with thinking of something that you’ll remember, but there’s a few things you need to keep in mind</p>
        <p><b>• Make it unique</b> - a big problem is people making their passwords easy to guess (e.g. “password”, “qwerty”, “123456”, mother’s maiden name). Try to think of something unique that no one else would guess.</p>
        <p><b>•	Use a variety of characters </b>- hackers can use software to cycle through possible variations of what your password could be. You’ve probably seen these guidelines on many websites, but they are there to protect you for this very reason. For a refresher:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>at least 8 characters (the more, the merrier)</p></li>
          <li><p>at least one uppercase and lowercase letter</p></li>
          <li><p>at least one number</p></li>
          <li><p>at least one symbol</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keeping these in mind for making passwords (even on websites that don’t require them) is a sure fire way to make your password more secure.</p>
        <p><b>•	Don’t use the same password for everything </b>- We know it’s hard to make different passwords for all the different accounts and it’s ok to use the same password for some websites but there are few things that you need to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><b>Your email password must be different from your other passwords </b>- this is a really important tip. If someone malicious has access to your email, they can then reset passwords on other accounts, making your issues much worse. Keeping your email password unique ensures that if one of your accounts are compromised, your email isn’t.</p> </li>
          <li><p><b>Get a password manager </b>– Password managers are a good way of keeping all your different password’s in one place. This could be anything from a notebook or an online software (one comes with a Google account). That means that you must have a unique and secure password if you have an online password manager (We’re sure you can understand why).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>•	Avoid common character substitutions</b>– “pa55w0rd” is just as easy for hackers to crack as “password”. Character substitutions can be a useful way of creating your own password, but just avoid the common ones.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><a>Multi Factor Authentication</a></h3>
        <p>As the internet get older, hackers get cleverer. Having a password to protect sensitive information is getting increasingly not enough. Luckily, there’s a way to add an extra layer of security, which is Multi Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is adding more layers of verification to gain access to a resource. There are three types of MFA:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Knowledge – This includes something like a password or a PIN</p></li>
          <li><p>Possession – This uses something that you own to prove you are you, like a smartphone or a chip</p></li>
          <li><p>Inherence – This is something that you are, so biometrics or voice recognition</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Adding this layer of security to your account will make you significantly less vulnerable to brute force attacks (hackers submitting many passwords to get into accounts)</p>
        <p>Hopefully you now know the important of secure passwords and what you can do to help yourself get more secure. You should also now know the benefits of MFA. With these pieces of knowledge, you can stay protected on the internet. </p>
