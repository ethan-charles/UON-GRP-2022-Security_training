## requirements and crtical path

Our initial pitch for the project was to create a website which was both informative and interactive. we decided that we would have a home page which would be split into multiple sections about cybersecurity; each would have a information teaching the user and then a small interactive game. After showing our initial design and sharing our ideas for the project during a meeting with the supervisors a clear aspect of the project became a priority. We decide to change the scope from multiple small games to one large email game which would have more functionality, we felt this gamification of cybersecurity issues was more likely to encourage people to learn so that instead of having to force people to do the training they would happily do it voluntarily. 

Another aspect of the project that we decide would be to much work for the benefit it provided was the implementation of a log in system. We initially thought this would be beneficial as it would allow the owner to see who had actually completed the cybersecurity training and what progress people had made. This was not a requirement for our supervisors so we decided it would be best to focus our resources on other functionality.

Because we are deciding to implement our project as a web app there is a multitude of software available to use. Originally we were looking at using Goole Web Designer for the project but after a bit of experimenting we decided it wasnâ€™t the right thing. For the mock-up we used Adobe XD and to create the functioning prototype we simply used html, java script and css.

When writing the code for the prototype we realised that to create the fake email being sent to the user we were having to hardcode a lot of information, this is not ideal; as such, if we decided to continue with this pure html and JS implementation we will use JSON files to store our data so that the necessary information for the dummy emails can be stored compactly outside of our html but can still be accessed quickly to ensure the functionality of the game. Furthermore, we may decide to create our game in the development kit UNITY, this may allow us to create a more polished game with functions which would not be practical to implement if coding from scratch ourselves, we could then host this on our website. We need to do more research into this to check if it is practical and if it is accessible enough on the different devices students have accesses to.

Our current requirements moving forward are:

1.	Have a platform to inform students on cybersecurity threats
2.	Have information on threats relevant to students
3.	Create the framework for the website such that it is expandable
4.	Work on devices with different screen sizes and resolution
5.	Work on different operating systems and in different browsers
6.	A simple interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate
7.	Not have a high required laptop specification to run so that it is available to all students regardless of device
8.	be accessible:
    1.	should be compatible with text reading software for the visually impairec
    
        -may not be able to implement on everything due to the nature of the game.

    2.	should follow standards for those with colour-blindness
    3.	compatible with translation software to help those with English as a second language

        -may not be able to implement on everything due to the nature of the game.

9.	able to run on smartphones(this is a stretch goal)
