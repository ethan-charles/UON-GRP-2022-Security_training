## project managment and progress

Throughout the project we have used an agile approach, specifically a scrum methodology. This allows us to have frequent meetings to stay updated and divide work. we currently meet every Monday morning during the lab and again on Thursday on a teams call to discuss our progress and bring up any problems we encountered so that they can be resolved before we meet again. By having two meetings a week we also reduced the impact of dependencies between tasks, for example one week we had two goals - create wireframes and a mock-up. wireframes were required to make an initial mock-up of how the website might look; Instead of having to wait a full week to start on the mock-up, we were able to complete both tasks within the week. 

Records of our meetings can easily accessed from the readme file on our git and evidence of meetings seen on our teams group. Furthermore, while originally using git to create issues to organise what we are all doing we have since moved to Trello as we found the software more complete and accessible to us. Informally we stay in touch over a group WhatsApp, which we use frequently to resolve scheduling issues and co-ordinate when working in pairs to complete tasks.

Due to the fact that we are developing a website to host a game, unit testing is very difficult, instead a user testing approach is required to gauge feedback on the design and implementation of the game. Our agile methodology has helped greatly with this as when developing our prototype we were able to give advice to each other weekly and gain feedback from friends after completing sprints to dictate how to move forward with the design.

Throughout our initial design period for the project we split the team effectively based on unique skills, for example: 

Shayeb did research into relevant cybersecurity risks that would be appropriate for university students and also which were feasible to implement on our website while following our goals of being, interactive, interesting and informative. This ended up with doing much more in depth analysis about phishing emails and email security in general after it became a keen aspect of the project for the client; changing our specifications from having multiple smaller games implemented on a website to one larger game with the framework in place to extend and add more games in the future.

Rafi was responsible for creating some initial wireframes for the website displaying how the layout should be displayed and how different webpages should link together, because of his previous experience gained at a-level.

Yichen and Dewei who have experience using a web development tool we hadnâ€™t heard of, Adobe XD, and were able to create a mock-up website that would go on do dictate how the webpage would look and display information to the user as well as the design of the email game specifically.

Ben, who took interest in how the game would work and the functionality behind created diagrams to display different game states and how the user would interact with the game, this provided an initial idea that was then built upon as a group after feedback from the project supervisors.

Leo created the initial functioning prototype for the game in html and java script which allowed us to work out issues with our plan and how we could resolve them as well as what ways to improve implementation; for example we are now looking at JSON files to store data that needs to easily be accessed for the functionality of the game.
