# Phishing Email Game  

You start with a 5 emails in the inbox.

There is a maximum number of emails in the inbox (say 15) and a time limit

Either send normal emails to a good folder and scam emails to a bad folder OR have the user flag them in the inbox

Speed of emails coming in will gradually increase.

System where interacting with emails will give you extra points (clicking on a link on a safe email will give you extra points but clicking on a link on a scam email will loose points)

One punishment on clicking on a link is that your "email is flagged as someone who interacts with scam emails" and will get a lot of emails all at once

Another punishment could put fake pop up ads on the screen.

To force the user to interact, a university email could be sent reprimanding them for not interacting.

Minigame: If your give out your password and don't have MFA on, then a there could be a minigame where you have to reset your password.
