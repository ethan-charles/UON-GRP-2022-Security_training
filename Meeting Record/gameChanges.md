# changes and additions to be implemented i the email game.

create javascript to add new grid items to the grid list.
(grid items are what store the email widgets)

fully implement 'flag' buttons in html and css - already partially done. 

create javascript functions to 'delete' email when flagged as spam. - discusiion about how to implement, mabye move to a different inbox. not sure how this would work.

create a game timer. may be difficult as javascript is not multithreaded, should be many tutorials though.

add scores to the different emails. and a global score variable, and add to it when an email is correvtly marked as spam.

change the timing emails are 'sent' to the inbox to be dynamic.

find a way to end the game when the inbox gets too full.

create different emails we will use. ( initally just need to be planned / done by hand, then need to be coded and added to json file).

source different images that we can use for profile pictures.

create a tutorial within the game.

create the website that the game can be accsesed from
